## Overview

Welcome to the Patchwork. Developed and maintained by The Newsmast Foundation.

Patchwork is a plugin dashboard designed to enhance your Mastodon server with advanced features and a streamlined admin experience, making stewardship of a Mastodon server easier, safer and more fun.



## Features

#### Opt users in to search 

By default, Mastodon users have to opt-in to allowing their profile and public posts to be indexed during searches. Patchwork enables the admin to choose whether all new users are opted-in to Search when they join. Users can always opt out if they choose.
#### Custom post length

Choose the maximum number of characters you want a post to be.
#### Auto-Bluesky bridge

Automatically bridge new users to Bluesky via Bridgy Fed. Users can always opt out if they choose. Please note, bridging takes place two weeks after the account has been created.
#### Spam block

Block spam posts arriving on your server from the federated network. Filters identify keywords or phrases associated with spam in a post. Create your own list for customised filters.
#### Content filters

Block harmful content arriving on your server from the federated network. Filters identify keywords or phrases in lists of words for specific harms eg. NSFW, Hate speech etc. Each list can be toggled on or off. Create your own list for customised filters.
#### Customise email branding

Replace the Mastodon logo in automatic emails with your own. This feature allows you to add your own header image, footer image and accent colour.
